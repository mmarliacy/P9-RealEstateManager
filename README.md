#### #General informations
***
*Real estate manager is an application that allows real estate agents to list properties acquired on behalf of a real estate company. 
This also allows them to have a visual of the property to present to the customer, including photos, information about the property, or even to know if the property has already been sold.*
Among other things, the application had the following features:
* Add/Remove/Update Property
* Filter the properties present in the list according to the criteria developed (Number of photos, price, size of the property...) on the basis of SQL queries.
* The real estate agent can find a map in the description of the property approximately locating it, thanks to the integration of Maps Static API.
* The real estate agent has the possibility of geolocating all the properties present in the application using a Maps card as well, thanks to the position markers.
* The connected real estate agent, thanks to Firebase authentication procedures, can also create properties in his name and find them at the same time.
